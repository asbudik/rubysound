#RubySound
Social music media player that allows users to search for songs and build their own playlists in a highly customizable environment.
##Overview
RubySound drew its inspiration from sharing great memories with great friends and great music. Users can search for songs to add to a playlist queue, and vote on the next songs to play in the queue list. Currently playing songs display upcoming events and venues that the artist will be playing at in the near future.
###Motivation
RubySound is fun! A dynamic single page app that allows users to quickly and easily add their favorite songs to a playlist queue and discover new music with other users. Upcoming artist events give users the ability to follow their favorite or new artists!

### To get started
When landing on the page, guests are able to fall in love with the current tracks being played in the queue. However, if you want to experience all the features, you will need to sign up or login. Signing up and logging in are a breeze. No page refreshes, and any errors on sign in are immediately presented to users so that they may quickly correct any errors. Users that are logged in may search for songs, pick a song, and have the ability to vote on any songs in the queue!
